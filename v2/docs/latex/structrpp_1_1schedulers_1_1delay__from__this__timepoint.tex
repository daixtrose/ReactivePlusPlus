\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Timepoint of next execution would be calculcated from timepoint of current scheduling. 

Implementation looks like this 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{const}\ \textcolor{keyword}{auto}\ timepoint\_for\_schedulable\ =\ schedulable-\/>get\_timepoint();}
\DoxyCodeLine{sleep\_until(timepoint\_for\_schedulable);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{const}\ \textcolor{keyword}{auto}\ duration\_from\_this\_timepoint\ =\ schedulable();}
\DoxyCodeLine{schedule(timepoint\_for\_schedulable\ +\ duration\_from\_this\_timepoint,\ schedulable);}

\end{DoxyCode}
