\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Operators is way to modify observables and extend with some extra custom logic. 

By default observable emits some values with some underlying logic. For example, it iterates over vector and emits values. But operators provide ability to make such an stream a bit more complex, for example, emit only SOME values, transform to string and etc. As a result, it would be ANOTHER stream of ANOTHER values, but more suitable for some specific case. \begin{DoxySeeAlso}{See also}
