Reactive\+Plus\+Plus is \href{https://reactivex.io/}{\texttt{ ReactiveX}} library for C++ language inspired by \char`\"{}official implementation\char`\"{} (\href{https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxCpp}{\texttt{ Rx\+Cpp}})

Main advantages of Reactive\+Plus\+Plus are that it is written in Modern C++ with Performance and Usage in mind. As a result it is fast, readable, easy to use and well-\/documented.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{What about existing Reactive Extension libraries for C++?}\label{index_autotoc_md1}
Reactive programming is excelent programming paradigm and approach for creation of multi-\/threading and real-\/time programs which reacts on some events. Unfortunately, there is only one stable and fully-\/implemented library at the moment of creation of Reactive\+Plus\+Plus -\/ \href{https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxCpp}{\texttt{ Rx\+Cpp}}.

\href{https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxCpp}{\texttt{ Rx\+Cpp}} is great and awesome library and perfect implementation of ReactiveX approach. However Rx\+Cpp has some disadvantages\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item It is a bit $\ast$$\ast$\char`\"{}old\char`\"{} library written in C++11$\ast$$\ast$ with some parts written in the {\bfseries{pre-\/\+C++11 style}} (mess of old-\/style classes and wrappers)
\item {\bfseries{Issue}} with {\bfseries{template parameters}}\+: {\ttfamily rxcpp\+::observable} contains {\bfseries{full chain of operators}} as second template parameter... where each operator has a bunch of another template parameters itself. It forces {\bfseries{IDEs}} works {\bfseries{slower}} while parsing resulting type of observable. Also it forces to generate {\bfseries{heavier binaries and debug symbols and slower build time}}.
\item It has high perfomance cost due to tremendous amount of usage of heap
\end{DoxyItemize}

Another implementation of RX for c++\+: \href{https://github.com/CODIANZ/another-rxcpp}{\texttt{ another-\/rxcpp}}. It partly solves issues of Rx\+Cpp via {\bfseries{eliminating of template parameter}} with help of {\bfseries{type-\/erasing}} and making each callback as {\ttfamily std\+::function}. As a result issue with templates resvoled, but this approach has disadvantages related to runtime\+: resulting size of observers/observables becomes greater due to heavy {\ttfamily std\+::function} object, usage of heap for storing everything causes perfomance issues, implementation is just pretty simple and provides a lot of copies of passed objects.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Why Reactive\+Plus\+Plus?}\label{index_autotoc_md2}
{\bfseries{Reactive\+Plus\+Plus}} tries to solve all mentioned issues\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Reactive\+Plus\+Plus}} written in {\bfseries{Modern C++ (C++20)}} with concepts which makes code-\/base a lot more understandable and clean\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Concepts provide more clear errors and checks
\item Everywhere while possible used deduction of template arguments, for example, type of values of observable by type of subscriber used in on\+\_\+subscribe and etc
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Reactive\+Plus\+Plus}} keeps balance between performance and type-\/erasing mechanism\+: Read about it in ./docs/\+Specific\%20vs\%20\+Dynamic.\+md \char`\"{}$\ast$$\ast$\char`\"{}Performance vs Flexibility\+: Specific vs Dynamic\char`\"{}$\ast$$\ast$\char`\"{}
\item {\bfseries{Reactive\+Plus\+Plus}} is fast\+: every part of code written with perfomance in mind. Starting from tests over amount of copies/move and finishing to Continous Benchmarking

Doxygen documentation generated per each commit can be found \href{https://victimsnino.github.io/ReactivePlusPlus/docs/html/index.html}{\texttt{ here}}

Manual documentation can be found in docs folder.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{Performance}\label{index_autotoc_md4}
Performance is really {\bfseries{important}}! It is {\bfseries{doubly important}} when we speak about {\bfseries{realtime applications and libraries}}! {\bfseries{Reactive\+Plus\+Plus}} targets as a realtime library to process and handle a tremendous volumes of data.

This repository uses continous benchmarking\+: every commit and pull request measured and diff per each benchmark provided. Graphs over benchmark results can be found \href{https://victimsnino.github.io/ReactivePlusPlus/benchmark}{\texttt{ here}}
